# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal is to further my learning and demonstrate the capabilities of the Kotlin programming language by developing a To-Do Application. This application serves as an example of how Kotlin can be used to create practical software solutions.

The Kotlin To-Do Application is a command-line program that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. It provides functionalities such as adding tasks, viewing existing tasks, and removing completed tasks. The application utilizes key Kotlin language features, including variables (both mutable and immutable), expressions, conditionals, loops, functions, and classes.

To implement this software, I created a main function that acts as the entry point for the application. Inside the main function, I utilized a mutable list to store the tasks entered by the user. By leveraging Kotlin's powerful standard library functions, I implemented the functionalities of adding tasks, viewing tasks, and removing tasks based on user input.

# Future Work

{Make a list of things that you need to fix, improve, and add in the future.}

- User Interface Enhancement: Currently, the To-Do application is a command-line program. Adding a graphical user interface (GUI) could provide a more intuitive and visually appealing user experience.
- Task Categorization: Implement the ability to categorize tasks into different categories or tags. This can help users organize their tasks more effectively and enable filtering or sorting based on categories.
- Task Due Dates and Reminders: Allow users to assign due dates to tasks and implement reminders or notifications to alert users about upcoming or overdue tasks.
